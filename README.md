# rusefi-ci

This dockerfile will automatically download and configure the github actions self-hosted runner

To run, first build the image with:

`docker build --build-arg GID=$(getent group docker | cut -d ':' -f 3) -t rusefi-ci .`

Then run the newly built image.

```bash
docker run --detach --privileged \
    -e RUNNER_NAME=test-runner2 \
    -e RUNNER_LABELS=ubuntu-latest \
    -e GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<Personal Access Token> \
    -e RUNNER_REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/<github user>/rusefi \
    rusefi-ci
```
Replace `<github user>` with your own username if you are running on your own fork.
If you are running an organization-level runner, you will need to replace `RUNNER_REPOSITORY_URL` with `RUNNER_ORGANIZATION_URL`.


Add `--restart=unless-stopped` in order to have the container survive reboots

The container uses a persistent volume mounted at /opt/actions-runner. After initial startup, the container will skip registration unless the peristent volume is erased.

## Environment variables

The following environment variables allows you to control the configuration parameters.

| Name | Description | Required/Default value |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| RUNNER_REPOSITORY_URL | The runner will be linked to this repository URL | Required if `RUNNER_ORGANIZATION_URL` is not provided |
| RUNNER_ORGANIZATION_URL | The runner will be linked to this organization URL. *(Self-hosted runners API for organizations is currently in public beta and subject to changes)* | Required if `RUNNER_REPOSITORY_URL` is not provided |
| GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN | Personal Access Token. Used to dynamically fetch a new runner token (recommended, see below). | Required if `RUNNER_TOKEN` is not provided.
| RUNNER_TOKEN | Runner token provided by GitHub in the Actions page. These tokens are valid for a short period. | Required if `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` is not provided
| RUNNER_WORK_DIRECTORY | Runner's work directory | `"_work"`
| RUNNER_NAME | Name of the runner displayed in the GitHub UI | Hostname of the container
| RUNNER_LABELS | Extra labels in addition to the default: 'self-hosted,Linux,X64' (based on your OS and architecture) | `""`
| RUNNER_REPLACE_EXISTING | `"true"` will replace existing runner with the same name, `"false"` will use a random name if there is conflict | `"true"`

## Runner Token

In order to link your runner to your repository/organization, you need to provide a token. There is two way of passing the token :

* via `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` (recommended), containing a [fine-grained Personnal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). This token will be used to dynamically fetch a new runner token, as runner tokens are valid for a short period of time.
  * For a single-repository runner, select the repository under "Only select repositories", then under "Repository Permissions" set "Administration" to read-write.
  * For an organization runner, select the repository and set "Organization self hosted runners"to read-write.
* via `RUNNER_TOKEN`. This token is displayed in the Actions settings page of your organization/repository, when opening the "Add Runner" page.

## Helper Functions

If you stop and start workes often, you may find it useful to have a function for starting workers. I have added the below functions to my .bashrc:

```bash
ghatoken ()
{
 echo -n "Paste token:"
 read TOKEN
 KEY=$(echo "$TOKEN" | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -pbkdf2 | tr -d '\n')
 perl -pi -e 's#(?<=TOKEN=\$\(echo\s").*?(?="\s\|)#'"$KEY"'#' $(realpath ~/.bashrc)
 bash
}

gha ()
{
  if ! TOKEN=$(echo "" | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -d -pbkdf2 ); then echo "Error encoding token"; return 1; fi
  NAME="runner-$1"
  LABEL=${2:-"ubuntu-latest"}
  IMAGE_HASH=$(docker image inspect rusefi-ci --format "{{.Id}}" 2>/dev/null)
  if CONTAINER_HASH=$(docker container inspect $NAME --format "{{.Image}}" 2>/dev/null) && [ "$IMAGE_HASH" = "$CONTAINER_HASH" ]; then
    docker start -i "$NAME"
  else
    if docker container inspect "$NAME" >/dev/null 2>/dev/null; then
      docker rm "$NAME"
    fi
    if [ -n "$3" ]; then
      MOUNT="-v $PWD/$3:/opt/actions-runner/rusefi-env:ro"
    fi
    docker run -it --privileged $MOUNT -e RUNNER_NAME="$NAME" -e RUNNER_LABELS="$LABEL" -e GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN="$TOKEN" -e RUNNER_REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/chuckwagoncomputing/rusefi --name $NAME rusefi-ci
  fi
}
```

Replace `<github user>` with your own username if you are running on your own fork.
If you are running an organization-level runner, you will need to replace `RUNNER_REPOSITORY_URL` with `RUNNER_ORGANIZATION_URL`.

Once the functions are in your .bashrc, and you have sourced your .bashrc, by opening a new shell or by running `. ~/.bashrc`,
run `ghatoken`, paste in your PAT, and enter a password. This password will be used every time you start a runner.

After you have run `ghatoken`, you can now start runners with `gha <id>`. I use sequential ids, e.g. `gha 1`, `gha 2`, etc,
but you may name them however you like. You can also pass a label, or multiple labels separated with a comma, as the second option. If omitted, `ubuntu-latest` will be used.

Note that these helper functions start the runner in interactive mode. If you prefer, you can remove the `-i` in `docker start -i` and replace the `-it` in `docker run -it` with `--detach`.

## Hardware CI

### udev Rules

_Assuming your host is Linux_

On your host machine, you need to make your board and ST-Link owned by the docker group.
Place this in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-rusefi.rules, replacing the serials with those of your board and ST-Link respectively.

```
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{serial}=="24001D001247393338343537", GROUP="docker"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{serial}=="066CFF3834344E5043242446", GROUP="docker"
```

If you have a ST-Link with binary data in the serial, it needs some special treatment. If you only have one, you can use the Product ID for the udev rule instead of the serial:

```
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="3748", GROUP="docker"
```

You can get these values by running `lsusb` and looking for your ST-Link.

If you have more than one ST-Link with a binary serial, things get more complicated. Paste this into a file somewhere:

```
tr -cs '\000-\177' '?' </sys/bus/usb/devices/$1/serial | grep -o . | while read l; do printf '\\x%02X' \"$l; done
```

Now we will make udev call that script, and compare the result to your serial. Change `/opt/getserial.sh` to the path where you stored the file. Replace the example serial in RESULT below with your serial.
[Gethla](https://github.com/a-v-s/gethla) can automatically find your device and give you the fully escaped serial.

```
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", PROGRAM="/bin/sh /opt/getserial.sh %k" RESULT=="\x49\x3F\x6A\x06\x48\x3F\x54\x53\x25\x50\x10\x3F", GROUP="docker"
```

### Configuring Runner

Prepare a file with the serial numbers of your hardware, like this one:

```
HARDWARE_CI_SERIAL=24001D001247393338343537
HARDWARE_CI_STLINK_SERIAL=066CFF3834344E5043242446
HARDWARE_CI_VBATT=12
```

If you have a ST-Link with binary data in the serial, use the escaped serial from gethla as described above, and wrap it in quotes. For example:

```
HARDWARE_CI_STLINK_SERIAL='\x49\x3F\x6A\x06\x48\x3F\x54\x53\x25\x50\x10\x3F'
```

Now when you first create your runner, you can pass this file as the third option on the command line.  
`gha f407-discovery hw-ci-f4-discovery rusefi-env`
